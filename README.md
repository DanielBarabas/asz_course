This is a first version using simulated data based upon the live balance panel on the CEU server. The panel version has some major flaws so this is just a proof of concept but the data can be updated anytime.

Simulation: simulate_from_params.ipynb
Dashboards: cross_section_dashboard.py and panel_dashboard.py (type `streamlit run panel_dashboard.py' to run)
